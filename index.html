			<h4>To me, travel has been a big part of my life. This map is a log of all the airports I have taken flights to and from. <br>
				Each orange dot represents an airport. Hovering over it shows you the name of the airport and municipality it is located in.<br>
				The lines depict the flight paths. They are 'geodesic', meaning that they show the true geographical shortest route.<br>
				A route more similar the one an airplane would take as opposed to just drawing a straight line on this map.<br>
				The geodesic lines add aesthetic appeal to the map but also give one an idea of just how distorted unprojected maps are.<br>
				The lines are colored blue and yellow for intranational and international flights. Being a washington state resident and <br>
				in close proximity to a large international airport in Vancouver, I take advantage of cheaper international ticket fares<br>
				and fly out of the Vancouver International Airport. For flights across the nation I use the 'Seatac' airport also known<br>
				as the Seattle-Tacoma Airport. When traveling to a European country from North America, often times you'll have a <br>
				layover in another country. Also, taking small flights known as 'puddle-jumpers' to close countries accounts for part<br> 
				of my across europe travel.<br>
